# UniSecret Example

This repo contains a pre-configured, ready-to-run Unity project showcasing some of the features that you can find in UniSecret.

To run, simply clone the repo and open it with Unity Hub (Import Project)

***Note!*** The most recent LTS version is required.

# Prebuilt binaries

A prebuilt game binary for Windows will be attached at some point soon, just in case, although it is recommended to explore the project through the Unity Editor with all the debug comments.
